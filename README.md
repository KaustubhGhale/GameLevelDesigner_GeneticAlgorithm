The Wumpus World is a well-established benchmark in artificial intelligence, used to evaluate agent behavior in environments characterized by uncertainty and partial observability. However, traditional implementations often rely on static or purely random level designs, which can result in unbalanced, trivial, or unsolvable scenarios. This project presents a novel approach to level generation in the Wumpus World by leveraging Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to produce progressively complex, solvable, and engaging environments.

Developed using Pygame, the system encodes each level configuration as a chromosome and evolves them over generations. A comprehensive fitness function evaluates each level based on solvability, path complexity, and hazard distribution, guiding the GA towards optimal designs. The implementation incorporates dynamic difficulty scaling, where the density of hazards such as Wumpuses and pits increases as generations progress, enhancing the challenge in a controlled manner. Furthermore, a “Fog of War” mechanic obscures unexplored areas of the grid, promoting exploration and aligning closely with the principles of partial observability.

The final outcome is a sequence of procedurally generated, playable levels that demonstrate the effectiveness of Genetic Algorithms in automating balanced content creation for intelligent systems. This work highlights the potential of evolutionary techniques in adaptive game design and intelligent environment generation
